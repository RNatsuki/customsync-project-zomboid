This server-side mod synchronizes real-time positions, health, and states of players, zombies, and vehicles across all clients. It also syncs player inventories on updates and death. Say goodbye to frustrating desync issues that ruin immersion and gameplay!

- Zombie Sync: Syncs up to 50 nearby zombies within range, including position, health, and direction for accurate threat tracking.
- Vehicle Sync: Ensures cars and trucks behave consistently, including position, speed, and engine health.
- Inventory Sync: Automatically syncs player inventories on container changes and upon death.
- Configurable Options: Adjust sync frequency, distance, and debug logging via the in-game sandbox menu – no server restarts needed!
- Optimized Performance: Filters entities by distance to reduce server load and network traffic, even with large player counts.
- Dynamic Updates: Change settings on-the-fly as admin without downtime.
- Debug Logging: Enable detailed logs for troubleshooting sync issues.

Installation:
1. Download and place the mod folder in your server's mods directory.
2. Enable the mod in your server's configuration.
3. Configure via the sandbox menu (Update Interval, Sync Distance, Debug Logs).

Perfect for dedicated servers, co-op play, and modded worlds. Tested on Build 42 – compatible with other mods.

Note: For best results, balance sync settings with your server's performance. High player counts may need tuning. Crawling and on-fire states are not synced due to Lua API limitations.
